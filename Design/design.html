                    Home page wireframe- I want to have an artwork as the focus of the home page while not distracting
                    from the navigation. I chose a cool da vinci type drawing I did a while a go, I think I would have
                    to clean it up more before using it on the final website. There is a colour theme based on the
                    artwork. Because the drawing is red, so is all the text. Which creates a kind of uniformity. The
                    social media icons are just placeholders for now and will have cleaner uniform designs. For the nav
                    bar buttons I used green boxes to contrast the red text.

                    Blog page wireframe- I think the blog post has the same issue of it feeling rigid. I do like the
                    larger variety in colours, it still keeps a simple warm tone. I want the blog post buttons to show
                    the summary of the blog post when the button gets hovered over. I will see if I can get that to work
                    in java. I still need to do wireframes for individual blog pages but I want them to be consistent in
                    style.

                    Essay page
                    I created one essay page so far, even though we need two at some point, but I will get there when I
                    get there. So later I will make an index page for the essays so you can pick which essay to read,
                    and to see summaries. For now I will have one essay page with the nav bar on top and a next essay
                    button, similar to the blog pages. I do not think I should include art like in the wireframe because
                    it might be too distracting, or it should be distant enough from the text.

                    Design Page
                    My design page is intended to showcase my wireframes and style guide. Currently, it consists of
                    pictures with some annotations, but the formatting is not finalized yet; I plan to refine it using
                    CSS. However, I'm not entirely satisfied with this wireframe yet. It looks too similar to the other
                    wireframes and doesn't seem to convey anything new. The colors I chose here were meant to match the
                    artwork, but they appear dull and create a brooding sort of vibe. I do not want to maintain that
                    vibe; instead, I may add some lighter colors to make it more cheerful and engaging.
