        <h2>Color Palette</h2>
        <p>
            I want the website to feel warm and relaxing, so I will use pastel colours and try to have warm earth tones
            and some green. I want to have an artwork on each page and use maybe 1 or two colours from that to create an
            even blend.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="imagery">
        <h2>Imagery</h2>
        <p>
            The artwork will be the main focus of my website. I will ensure that the images of the artwork are
            high-quality and are displayed prominently. The artwork images will be complemented by my chosen color
            palette to create a cohesive look and feel.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="layout">
        <h2>Layout</h2>
        <p>
            The website layout will be designed in a way that each section is distinct yet part of a cohesive whole.
            This will be achieved by using different colors for each section as per my color palette. The layout will be
            clean and uncluttered, ensuring the artwork remains the focal point.
        </p>
    </section>

    <h2>Fonts</h2>
    <p>
        The Amasis MT Pro Black font is like a friendly face in the crowd. It’s a slab serif font, which means it has
        these little feet at the end of the strokes. But unlike other slab serifs that are more rigid and geometric,
        Amasis MT Pro Black is more laid-back and organic. It’s bold and stands out, so it’s great for headlines or
        anything you want to pop. Even though it’s a modern font, it has a timeless feel to it.
    </p>

    <h2>Readability and Legibility</h2>
    <p>
        One of the best things about this font is that it’s super easy to read, whether it’s on a printed page or a
        digital screen. Plus, it has a bunch of glyphs, so it can handle a wide range of characters.
    </p>

    <h2>Colours</h2>
    <p>
        My website will feature a warm, earthy, and natural colour palette. These colours, inspired by nature, will
        include shades of brown, green, red, and beige.
    </p>

    <h2>Colour Theory and Relationships</h2>
    <p>
        In terms of colour theory, my chosen palette is quite harmonious. The warm earth tones are analogous, meaning
        they are next to each other on the colour wheel. This creates a pleasing harmony and cohesiveness. The green,
        depending on its hue, can act as a complementary colour to the reds, providing a nice contrast and making my
        website visually interesting.
    </p>

    <h2>Composition</h2>
    <p>
        The layout of my website will be clean and uncluttered. Each section will have its own distinct colour, creating
        a visually interesting composition that guides the user’s eye through the site.
    </p>

    <h2>Hierarchy, Balance, Harmony</h2>
    <p>
        The design of my website will maintain a balance between different elements, creating a sense of harmony. The
        hierarchy of information will be clearly defined, guiding users intuitively through the content.
    </p>

    <h2>Interface Elements - The Visual Representations</h2>
    <p>
        Interface elements such as buttons, icons, and menus will be designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. They
        will be visually consistent with the overall design aesthetic of the website.
    </p>

    <h2>Shape, Colour, Position</h2>
    <p>
        The shape, colour, and position of each element on my website will be carefully considered to create a cohesive
        and engaging user experience. The artwork will act decorative but not take away from the UI. I want to have an
        artwork on each page and have my website feel like a gallery.
