                <p>The scramble for Africa marked the colonization of most of the continent by seven Western powers.
                    Today, a
                    similar dynamic persists, but it is technologically driven. This essay defines digital colonialism
                    and
                    contextualizes the research object which is the large-scale Google layoffs that occurred in May
                    2024. By
                    employing Sareeta Amrute’s framework, this analysis will explore whether these technological
                    practices can be
                    considered colonial. The essay will then connect this analysis to the state of South African
                    developers. It
                    argues that while the increase in foreign outsourcing provides jobs to South African developers, it
                    may also be
                    exploitative.</p>

                <h2>What is digital colonialism?</h2>
                <p>To understand digital colonialism, we must first define colonialism. According to Amrute, "At its
                    simplest,
                    colonialism is a practice of acquiring full or partial control over another country, territory, or
                    people,
                    occupying it, sometimes with settlers, sometimes indirectly, and exploiting it economically."
                    Colonialism
                    exploits the occupied country’s resources to benefit the colonizer.</p>
                <p>Digital colonialism is defined by Danialle Coleman as “decentralized extraction and control of data
                    from citizens
                    without explicit consent through communication networks developed and owned by Western tech
                    companies.” (Coleman
                    2019).</p>

                <h2>Research object</h2>
                <p>In May 2024 Google retrenched 200+ employees including members of its core team. According to
                    Google's website,
                    the core team are responsible for “building the technical foundation behind the company’s flagship
                    products and
                    for protecting users’ online safety.’’. Core teams include key technical units from information
                    technology, its
                    Python developer team, technical infrastructure, security foundation, app platforms, core
                    developers, and
                    various engineering roles.” (Elias, 2024). They are planning to replace this local labor with
                    foreign labor
                    specifically from India and Mexico. These countries offer skilled labor at a fraction of the current
                    cost.</p>

                <h2>Digital colonization framework</h2>
                <p>Sareeta Amrute is an associate anthropology professor. Her keynote talk on tech and colonialism will
                    be described
                    specifically her framework for considering whether tech is colonial. This essay will debate the
                    coloniality of
                    Google’s labor exchange as depicted by her.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Is it hierarchical?</li>
                    <li>Is it extractive?</li>
                    <li>Is it exploitative?</li>
                    <li>Does it produce uneven consequences?</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>1. Technology is hierarchical.</h3>
                <p>Hierarchies are ranking systems where people at the top of the hierarchy have the most authority,
                    influence and
                    benefits, and these factors decrease as you go down the hierarchy.</p>
                <h3>2. Extraction</h3>
                <p>Extractive systems take resources (including labor) from one area to benefit another, often without
                    fair
                    compensation or regard for long-term consequences.</p>
                <h3>3. Exploitation</h3>
                <p>Exploitation occurs through labor relations that take advantage of imbalances in power and economic
                    conditions in
                    the world.</p>
                <h3>4. Uneven consequences</h3>
                <p>Ms. Amrut explains that “Technological innovation’s collateral damage means that the consequences of
                    development
                    are felt unevenly, with harms accruing to black and brown communities in the United States, and
                    Indigenous,
                    poor, and oppressed communities in Latin America, South Asia, and Africa”.</p>
                <h2>South African Context</h2>
                <p>South Africa (SA) is described as an IT hub in the SADEC region. Maureen Tanner in her article
                    “Communication and
                    Culture in Global Software Development: The Case of Mauritius and South Africa," explains how the
                    country’s
                    diverse cultural heritage fosters communication and adaptability, which is an advantage in
                    navigating digital
                    colonization complexities.</p>
                <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
                <p>Using Amrute’s framework to analyse the Google layoffs, this essay concludes that these actions can
                    be seen as a
                    manifestation of digital colonialism, fitting the four factors identified by her. By connecting
                    these factors to
                    the South African software development industry, the analysis reveals a nuanced landscape. While the
                    increase in
                    remote work opportunities provides jobs, the significant pay disparities highlight potential
                    exploitation.</p>
