    <h2> GitHub experience<h2>
    <p1>I have used GitHub before in 2nd year. it was intimidating then but now it’s just foreboding now.
     maybe it’s because I have not watched the video yet but there is a lot of new vocab for me,
      or rather instructions that sound like every 3rd word is made up. 
      I suppose all words are made up. Hanli and Brendan made the experience followable so i am to the point where I need to deploy
       the website but my 15 minutes of concentration had finished so i here is where i lay. what do you mean deploy...  </p1>
    
   <p1> a few days later... &nbsp;
    I asked a friend and they showed me how to deploy.</p1>
    
</p1> lets talk about the readings though.
    most of them have a weird font so it pushed me to read the reading with the most reasonable readable writing.
     that happened to be the tower of babel. the tower of Bable is a bit slow and I was unsure what it had to do with anything until
      I remembered we are making websites.</p1>
    
    </p1>  the tower of babel is a piece about this seemingly infinite library. a vessel for all knowledge. 
     the walls of the library are mirrors, creating the perception of limitlessness. however this library is infinite, each book seems
      as though there are a random assortment of letters, however when you combine the words and books in certain combinations it 
      actually provides an infinite source of knowledge. just like the internet (to a degree). the random letters assorted correctly, 
      give you info in the tower, but on the internet it is links and code that do this. this assortment of random letters in a pattern
       send you to different websites with different information. the contemporary version of the tower of babel is the internet itself. </p1> 
    

   <h2>My goals for this course</h2> 
    
    <p> am an artist, and recently I have tried selling some of my work. I would like to have a website dedicated to my art. 
    i want my website to be efficient and creative. I want my website to look almost sketch like. the lines maybe not being as clean
     or organized but the aesthetics easily readable. I want to know what makes a good website and what makes a bad one. 
     I am also looking for skills that can’t be replaced by AI.</p>
