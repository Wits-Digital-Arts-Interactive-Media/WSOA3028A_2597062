            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Interaction, as defined by Bardin, R. (2023), is “the meeting point between an active body and something
                that it can affect in some way.” This essay aims to analyse the interaction design and ethical
                components of BOBZA, a South African shopping website. [BOBZA URL here] The analysis will focus on two
                elements of interaction design (IxD) - User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX), along with the
                site’s relevant ethics. This essay will limit its scope to the homepage, buying and selling. This is
                because the website will be consistent with its homepage in terms of style and buying and selling are
                ultimately the goals of the website.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Overview of BOBZA</h2>
            <p>
                BOBZA is a retail platform dedicated to showcasing and selling African products to Africans.
                <a href="https://bobza.co.za/"> Bobza</a>
                Their mission, as stated on their website, is “To create a more representative retail industry and
                online marketplace in Africa by empowering and showcasing African brands, stimulating local
                entrepreneurship, and fostering economic growth across the continent.”

            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>User Interface (UI)</h2>
            <p>
                This refers to the graphical layout of an application or website. It consists of the button’s users
                click on, the text they read, the images, sliders, text entry fields, and all the rest of the items the
                user interacts with. This includes screen layout, transitions, interface animations, and every single
                micro-interaction. To sum it up UI is all the way the user interacts with the website.
                The BOBZA website has the purpose of being a shopping website where people can order items for delivery
                or pick up, they also have the option of applying to sell their own products. So lets talk about the
                homepage, what can you do, what can you see, what works and what does not work.

            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Homepage</h3>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="/Images/bobza homepage 1.png" alt="Screenshot of bobza homepage" class="image"
                    title="Bobza homepage" width="750" height="600">
                <p> The homepage is a clean simple page with a navigation bar, product advertisement, information
                    regarding
                    collection, featured and new products. The buttons are self-explanatory and are consistent with web
                    design standards. To see the featured and new products the user has to scroll down the page past a
                    few
                    pictures about what the website can do for you. When comparing BOBZA to other shopping websites like
                    Takealot or pick pay, they also have a similar content flow, however their featured products are
                    shown
                    earlier. When you do reach the products there is an ability to hover over the product to see the
                    buttons
                    quick view or add to cart. I found this a very effective Ui choice as a customer’s agency is
                    typically
                    limited to that. Which is to find out more information of a product, add to cart, or scroll past the
                    product. </p>
                <p>
                    UI analysis of BOBZA focuses on the visual aspect of the website and its interactivity. Upon initial
                    view of the homepage, users are drawn to the information regarding product pick-up and delivery, and
                    the
                    navigation bar. However, new users may be unaware of the type of products sold or the identity of
                    BOBZA.
                    As users scroll down, they encounter a picture of the Sandton skyline with the phrase “Delivering
                    the
                    best of Africa to your door,” followed by two hyperlinks. One link invites user to rate their
                    shopping
                    experience, and the other advertises shoes featured by BOBZA.
                </p>
                Towards the bottom of the page, users finally see what appears to be BOBZA’s primary focus - their
                products. The products are displayed with clear images, which also serve as buttons leading to the
                product information page. Users can view stock or add items to their cart by hovering over the images.
                All buttons respond quickly, enhancing the site’s interactivity. On the side of the page there is a shop
                button which opens a tab with the categories of the products BOBZA offers. These category buttons offer
                an efficient way to browse the products on the BOBZA website. My lecturer in class expressed the idea of
                the three clicks rule, it should not take more than 3 clicks to do what you want to do. The BOBZA
                website follows this rule on pc devices however because of the phones inability to hover extra buttons
                are there.

                The viewport is consistent with mobile devices, the screen is fitted well, and the buttons are the same.
                The only major difference is that you cannot hover over products on the mobile site so underneath the
                products are the buttons to view the product and add to cart.

                </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Product review page</h3>
            <p>
                The product review page has a clear picture of the product with 3 additional options to see different
                angles. There are buttons and scroll wheel to determine quantity and if the product is an item of
                clothing there is size options as well. Users can also rate the product, add to cart, and or add to
                Wishlist. These are consistent with other online shopping sites. It is difficult to exist out of the
                product review page as the exist button is invisible unless you hover over it, you cannot exit that tab
                by clicking outside of it. That is something they could implement to improve UX. The mobile version does
                not have this issue.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>User Experience (UX)</h2>
            <p>
                The detailed UX analysis focuses on what users feel when they interact with the website. It examines how
                well the site achieves its goals and meets user expectations. The analysis also discusses the site’s
                diversity, its strengths, areas for improvement, and shortcomings.
                The products have a side scroll which creates the feeling of browsing items, which is the correct
                feeling to evoke in shopping.

            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Visual Design</h3>
            <p>
                The homepage’s initial view feels somewhat cluttered due to the placement of pictures (also hyperlinks),
                giving it a collage-like appearance. This layout does not effectively communicate what sets BOBZA apart
                from other shopping websites. A comparison with a website like Takealot reveals similarities, but
                Takealot has a larger market presence and a more extensive loyal customer base. Therefore, highlighting
                BOBZA’s mission on the front page could potentially attract more users. The main colour scheme is yellow
                and white which creates a warm inviting feeling.
            </p>
            <p>
                The products are arguably the most important parts of the website so how are they portrayed. The product
                is first shown with a big clear picture with a grey small font showing the brand, below that is the name
                of the product in a bigger bolder font and below that is the price shown in the same font as the brand.
                This could be improved, while all the relevant information is clear, the price should always stand out
                as that is what the user will initially focus on. This is corrected in the product view page.
            </p>

            <h2>Ethics</h2>
            <p>There is a grey area in web design where designing things in a certain way is lawful however it is not
                ethical, this can be using dark patterns which lead users to do things that they didn’t intend to do.
                This could be purchasing a product or subscribing to a website without wanting to or taking more
                personal information than necessary. BOBZA does not use dark pattern designs and throughout the entire
                purchasing process everything is intentional.</p>
            <p>According to Capacity Interactive, ethics in web design is about putting your users first. “Ethical web
                design, simply put, is about putting your users first. It’s a thinking approach that questions how your
                website serves its visitors and the planet. It’s not necessarily meant to focus on good vs. bad
                practices but rather how you evaluate your practices.” (Capacity Interactive 2021)</p>
            <p>BOBZA is a company that services a previously marginalized group of people and supports local businesses,
                so beyond the web design BOBZA is inherently ethical as it speaks towards equality and the
                socio-economic goals of the country.</p>
            <p>Capacity Interactive speaks these points on evaluating if your website is ethical: Accessibility,
                inclusion, privacy and security, and device first design.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Accessibility and Inclusion</h3>
            <p>“Creating accessible and inclusive digital spaces provides meaningful experiences to everyone regardless
                of any disability or their access to modern technology” (Capacity Interactive 2021). It is important
                that websites be accessible to people with disabilities or without certain technologies. The BOBZA
                website does not have alt text for their pictures but do have a read mode. They could have settings to
                retrofit their website to be suitable to colorblind people, and people with dyslexia.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Privacy and Security</h3>
            <p>The BOBZA website does ask for permission to use or reject cookies. And when reaching the purchasing
                page, they do state that payments are secure and that they follow the Consumer Goods and Services Code.
                When purchasing the only personal questions they require are your name, surname, phone number, address,
                city, and country.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the BOBZA website effectively utilizes interaction design principles to create a
                user-friendly shopping experience. The site’s UI is intuitive and visually appealing, with clear
                navigation and efficient browsing options. The UX is enhanced by quick response times and a
                straightforward process for viewing and purchasing products. However, the site could improve its initial
                presentation to new users by providing more immediate information about its product offerings and brand
                identity. Overall, BOBZA demonstrates a strong commitment to its mission of empowering and showcasing
                African brands, contributing to a more representative retail industry in Africa.</p>
