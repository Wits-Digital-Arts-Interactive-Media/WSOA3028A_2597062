                    Home page wireframe- I want to have an artwork as the focus of the home page while not distracting
                    from the navigation. I chose a cool da vinci type drawing I did a while a go, I think I would have
                    to clean it up more before using it on the final website. There is a colour theme based on the
                    artwork. Because the drawing is red, so is all the text. Which creates a kind of uniformity. The
                    social media icons are just placeholders for now and will have cleaner uniform designs. For the nav
                    bar buttons I used green boxes to contrast the red text.

                    Blog page wireframe- I think the blog post has the same issue of it feeling rigid. I do like the
                    larger variety in colours, it still keeps a simple warm tone. I want the blog post buttons to show
                    the summary of the blog post when the button gets hovered over. I will see if I can get that to work
                    in java. I still need to do wireframes for individual blog pages but I want them to be consistent in
                    style.

                    Essay page
                    I created one essay page so far, even though we need two at some point, but I will get there when I
                    get there. So later I will make an index page for the essays so you can pick which essay to read,
                    and to see summaries. For now I will have one essay page with the nav bar on top and a next essay
                    button, similar to the blog pages. I do not think I should include art like in the wireframe because
                    it might be too distracting, or it should be distant enough from the text.

                    Design Page
                    My design page is intended to showcase my wireframes and style guide. Currently, it consists of
                    pictures with some annotations, but the formatting is not finalized yet; I plan to refine it using
                    CSS. However, I'm not entirely satisfied with this wireframe yet. It looks too similar to the other
                    wireframes and doesn't seem to convey anything new. The colors I chose here were meant to match the
                    artwork, but they appear dull and create a brooding sort of vibe. I do not want to maintain that
                    vibe; instead, I may add some lighter colors to make it more cheerful and engaging.

        <h2> Wireframes iteration 3 and 4</h2>
        <p><strong>Image Slider Concept:</strong><br>
        <div class="container">

                    For the homepage, I decided to incorporate a Java image slider to showcase some of my most recent
                    works. Since this website serves as my portfolio, I wanted the homepage to immediately grab
                    visitors' attention with a dynamic display of my art. I also created a consistent navigation bar
                    design that I plan to use across all pages to maintain a cohesive look and feel

        <p><strong>Navigation Bar Iteration:</strong><br>

                <p>
                    Inspired by many of my peers who use large buttons for navigation, I experimented with a similar
                    approach. I believe this design not only looks visually appealing but also has the potential to work
                    well for mobile responsiveness. However, I am aware that animating the images could be a significant
                    task, so I'm considering simpler transitions to avoid overwhelming the user.

        <p><strong>Color Palette Considerations:</strong><br>
        <div class="container">
            <img src="../Images/3.png	" alt="Design wireframe" class="image">
            <div class="annotation">
                <p>
                    While I initially used green to signify the homepage, feedback from Imaan suggested that the
                    contrast wasn't clear enough. I plan to revise the color scheme to ensure better visual hierarchy
                    and clarity. Although red is my favorite color, I understand that it can make text harder to read
                    and might convey an intense vibe, which may not align with the website's overall tone.

        <p><strong>Blog Menu Design:</strong><br>

            <div class="annotation">
                <p>
                    I thought incorporating big buttons for the blog menu could be visually striking. However, I
                    realized that including titles would be more informative for users. Upon further exploration, I
                    discovered timeline designs, which I believe could be a more engaging and structured way to present
                    the blog menu, as shown in the next image

                    Initially, I used a red color scheme for the essay layout, but after feedback from Imaan, I
                    reconsidered this choice due to its potential overwhelming effect. I experimented with a yellow
                    navigation bar in the next iteration, which I found visually appealing. However, I'm still refining
                    the layout to ensure readability and visual appeal without compromising the overall design.
