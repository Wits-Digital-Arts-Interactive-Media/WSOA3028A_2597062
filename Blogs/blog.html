    <h1>Welcome to my blog page</h1>

    <h2>Week 1</h2>

    <p>I have used GitHub before in 2nd year. It was intimidating then but now it is just foreboding now.
        Maybe it is because I have not watched the video yet but there is a lot of new vocab for me,
        or rather instructions that sound like every 3rd word is made up.
        I suppose all words are made up. Hanli and Brendan made the experience followable so I am to the point where I
        need to deploy
        the website but my 15 minutes of concentration had finished so I here is where I lay. What do you mean deploy...
    </p>

    <p>A few days later... I asked a friend and they showed me how to deploy.</p>

    <p>Lets talk about the readings though.
        Most of them have a weird font so it pushed me to read the reading with the most reasonable readable writing.
        That happened to be the tower of babel. The tower of Babel is a bit slow and I was unsure what it had to do with
        anything until
        I remembered we are making websites.
    </p>

    <p>The tower of babel is a piece about this seemingly infinite library. A vessel for all knowledge.
        The walls of the library are mirrors, creating the perception of limitlessness. However, this library is
        infinite, each book seems
        as though there are a random assortment of letters, however when you combine the words and books in certain
        combinations it
        actually provides an infinite source of knowledge. Just like the internet (to a degree). The random letters
        assorted correctly,
        give you info in the tower, but on the internet, it is links and code that do this. This assortment of random
        letters in a pattern
        send you to different websites with different information. The contemporary version of the tower of babel is the
        internet itself.

    <h3>My goals for this course</h3>

    <p>I am an artist, and recently I have tried selling some of my work. I would like to have a website dedicated to my
        art.
        I want my website to be efficient and creative. I want my website to look almost sketch-like, the lines maybe
        not being as clean
        or organized but the aesthetics easily readable. I want to know what makes a good website and what makes a bad
        one.
        I am also looking for skills that cannot be replaced by AI.

    <h2> Week 2 Blog Post</h2>

    <h3>Week 2 Reading</h3>
    <p>For week 2, I did a reading called <em>‘You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media
            (1991)’</em> by Moulthrop,S (2003).
        You can find the reading <a
            href="https://williamwolff.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/moulthrop-hypertext-1993.pdf">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>What is Hypertext?</h3>
    <p>The reading is about Hypertext, which is a kind of specially-formatted text that provides a link to other
        content. Unlike linear text (such as a book),
        hypertext allows you to immediately access text in various electronic sources by clicking on hyperlinks. You can
        learn more about hypertext <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/hypertext">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Relevance to Today's Internet</h3>
    <p>The reading talks about how technology has changed our habits, particularly in how we interact with hyperlinks.
        Hypertext was once thought to replace books, providing a source of information where one can move to different
        sources of information. This ability to learn in a non-linear way is reflected in our modern use of technology.
    </p>
    <p>When we look at our interests, we can expand our knowledge based on patterns, such as hashtags or search engine
        results. These are prevalent on social media sites. However, while instant access to knowledge is convenient, it
        also contributes to a shorter attention span. The ability to consume multiple streams of information at once
        makes us less immersed in the technology we use. The nonlinear nature of hyperlinks can cause people to go down
        rabbit holes, sometimes to expand knowledge, but other times as a distraction.</p>
    <p>Additionally, apps that act as browsers, like Instagram, tend to centralize information around specific themes.
        For example, Instagram is often used for entertainment, so it may shadow ban certain agendas or concepts.</p>

    <h2> Week 3 Blog Post</h2>
    <h3> Alignment</h3>

    <p>User Alignment- is designing and structuring my website in a way that meets the needs, expectations, and
        behaviors of the target users.</p>
    <p>My current main goal is to create a website as a new platform for my art as a portfolio and as a product. Besides
        that, I also want to get a good mark for my interactive media class. So, I plan to have a responsive,
        accessible, concise artistic website.</p>
    <p>What I want my users to see ultimately is my art, and I want to convey my art in a creative way that highlights
        the art of web design.</p>

    <h3>My Users</h3>
    <p><strong>What I want my users to do:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>To view my portfolio.</li>
        <li>To engage with my art, like understanding its significance and meaning.</li>
        <li>To be able to contact me for commissions and or collaborations.</li>
        <li>To connect with my social media.</li>
        <li>To be able to purchase artwork.</li>
        <li>To be aware of any potential events or projects I am in or working on.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Who is my target audience?</h3>
    <p>As an artist, my target audience for your website could include art enthusiasts, collectors, potential clients,
        galleries, and fans of my work. They are likely on my website to explore and appreciate your artwork, learn more
        about you as an artist, and potentially purchase or commission artwork.</p>

    <h3>What do they want to see?</h3>
    <p>My audience wants to see a visually appealing and well-organized portfolio showcasing my artwork. They may also
        be interested in learning about my artistic process, inspirations, and upcoming events or exhibitions.
        Additionally, they may want to easily contact me for inquiries or collaborations.</p>
