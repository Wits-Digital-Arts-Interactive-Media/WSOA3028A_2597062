            <h2>Alignment</h2>
            <p>User Alignment - designing and structuring my website to meet the needs, expectations, and behaviors of
                the target users.</p>
            <p>My current main goal is to create a website as a new platform for my art as a portfolio and product.
                Additionally, I aim to achieve a good mark for my interactive media class, planning to have a
                responsive, accessible, and concise artistic website.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, I want my users to see my art and convey it in a creative way that highlights the art of web
                design.</p>
