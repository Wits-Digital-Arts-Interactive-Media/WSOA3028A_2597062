            <h2>Reflection on Reading</h2>
            <p>After reading this article, I've been thinking a lot about the moral side of the internet and online spaces.
                The idea of "proper distance" from Roger Silverstone really struck a chord with me. He talks about how we need
                to find the right amount of closeness in our online interactions to feel responsible and caring towards others.
                This is different from just focusing on being connected or interactive.</p>
            <p>I agree that a lot of discussions about the internet are too focused on things like social networking, weak vs
                strong ties, and reciprocity. While those concepts are useful, they don't really get at the moral implications of
                how we communicate online. I think Silverstone is right that just because we feel close to someone online, it
                doesn't mean we actually feel a real sense of responsibility towards them.</p>
            <p>The article also made me reflect on the anonymity and lack of physical presence in many online interactions. It's
                easy to just "switch off" and disengage when you're not face-to-face with someone. But Silverstone argues that as
                moral beings, we can't just ignore our duty to care for others, even in mediated online spaces. This is a
                challenging idea.</p>

            <h2>Application</h2>
            <p>In terms of my own website, I'm wondering how I could try to foster more of a sense of moral responsibility and
                proper distance in the way people interact. Maybe I could have some guidelines or community norms that encourage
                empathy, authenticity and care for diverse perspectives. I could also try to design the site in a way that doesn't
                just reward reciprocity and interactivity, but also makes space for less reciprocal forms of support and
                connection.</p>
