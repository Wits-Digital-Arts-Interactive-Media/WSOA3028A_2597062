        <h2>Internet Access as a Fundamental Right</h2>
        <p>In the article "Internet Access is a Fundamental Right" by Spyros Kasapis, the author argues that internet
            access should be considered a fundamental human right, a view that gained particular relevance during the
            COVID-19 pandemic. Kasapis highlights how the pandemic has underscored social inequalities, particularly in
            terms of the digital divide, where not everyone has access to the internet. This "digital inequality" has
            created a gap between those who can fully participate in the digital age and those who cannot (RanchordaÃÅs,
            2020).</p>

        <p>The impact of this digital divide was evident in various aspects of life, including education and healthcare.
            Many students were unable to access remote learning, while others faced challenges registering online for
            vaccines and accessing general health information related to COVID-19. Personal experiences during the
            pandemic have highlighted the internet's critical role, with basic interactions and essential information
            predominantly shared and distributed online.</p>

        <p>The article argues that internet access should be considered a human right, akin to other basic rights such
            as food, education, and healthcare. It emphasizes the internet's importance in providing access to
            information, opportunities, and social inclusion.</p>

        <p>The pandemic also accelerated the shift towards a digital economy, where internet access became essential.
            The lack of access to the internet can lead to exclusion from economic activities and educational
            opportunities. For instance, some companies stopped accepting physical cash and transitioned to digital
            transactions only, such as Electronic Funds Transfers (EFTs).</p>

        <p>In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical role of internet access as a fundamental
            human right. Ensuring universal access to the internet is essential for bridging the digital divide and
            providing equitable opportunities for all.</p>
