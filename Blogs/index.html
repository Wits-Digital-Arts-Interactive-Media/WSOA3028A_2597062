    <h1> Hi Welcome to my blog page</h1>


    <div>
        <p>from this page you will be able to see short descriptions of each of my blogs and be able to navigate to find
            which one you'd like to read</p>

        <h2>Blog Posts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="#"><strong> Week 1</strong></a><br>
                My first experiences coding in HTML, trying to get GitHub to work, and my response to the reading "Tower
                of Babel" (<a href="#">link to reading</a>).
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="#"><strong> Week 2</strong></a><br>
                The reading was about hypertext and I respond to it by unpacking its relevance today. I also underlined my
                folder structure and URL set up.
            </li>
            <!-- Add more blog post items with href="#" to the same page -->
        </ul>

        import { initialise } from "./scripts/menu.js";
        initialise("Blogs"); // Call the initialise function with a test argument
