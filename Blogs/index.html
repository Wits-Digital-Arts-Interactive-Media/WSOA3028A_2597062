            <strong>Week 1</strong> - <a href="blog.html">Read Blog Post</a><br>
            My first experiences coding in HTML, trying to get GitHub to work, and my response to the reading "Tower of Babel" (<a href="#">link to reading</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Week 2</strong> - <a href="blog2.html">Read Blog Post</a><br>
            The reading was about hypertext and I respond to it by unpacking its relevance today. I also underlined my folder structure and URL set up.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Week 3</strong> - <a href="blog3.html">Read Blog Post</a><br>
            I did some investigating to find out my user alignment and who my users are.
