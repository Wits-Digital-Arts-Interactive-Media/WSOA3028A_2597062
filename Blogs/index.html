    <ul>
        <li>
             <a href="blog.html"><strong> Week 1</strong></a><br>
            My first experiences coding in HTML, trying to get GitHub to work, and my response to the reading "Tower of Babel" (<a href="#">link to reading</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="blog2.html"><strong> Week 2</strong></a><br>
            The reading was about hypertext and I respond to it by unpacking its relevance today. I also underlined my folder structure and URL set up.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="blog3.html"><strong> Week 3</strong></a><br>
            I did some investigating to find out my user alignment and who my users are.
        </li>
    </ul>
