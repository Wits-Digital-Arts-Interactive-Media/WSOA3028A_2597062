        <h2>Critical Reflection on JavaScript</h2>
        <p>In this week's exploration of JavaScript, I encountered some challenges with implementing a navigation bar.
            Initially, I copied the code from our class lecture, but it wasn't functioning as expected. I spent a
            significant amount of time debugging, only to discover that I needed to run the code on a live server. This
            realization was frustrating and left me feeling a bit embarrassed.</p>

        <p>To address this issue, I decided to keep my HTML hyperlinks in case the website isn't marked with a live
            server. However, I'm aware that this approach makes the page look a bit messy with both HTML and JavaScript
            code visible.</p>

        <p>Following the navigation bar, I focused on enhancing user experience by adding a "scroll to the top" button
            using JavaScript. This feature aims to improve usability, especially for users navigating long pages.</p>

        <p>Despite my efforts, I encountered challenges with implementing a feature to show summaries of blog posts when
            hovering over their links. While I was unsuccessful in achieving this functionality at the moment, I remain
            determined to explore and resolve this issue in the future.</p>

        <h2>What I Improved and Why</h2>
        <p>After receiving an unexciting mark, I decided to delve deeper into coding. I learned about metadata and
            implemented it in my project. I also created wireframes for each file I would have, although I still need to
            create more. I ensured that all my blogs were present and formatted correctly, or at least I think so.
            Overall, I put in more time and effort than before and made sure to align my work with the rubric's
            requirements.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>What I Still Need to Improve</h2>
        <p>I still need to create more detailed wireframes and provide written annotations for the pictures. I believe
            CSS will allow me to fix things more easily and might even be more enjoyable, but I need to start working on
            it earlier. Additionally, I need to engage in more frequent reflection to track my progress and identify
            areas for improvement.</p>
