     <h2>Week 2 Reading</h2>
     <p>For week 2, I did a reading called <em>‘You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media
               (1991)’</em> by Moulthrop,S (2003).
          You can find the reading <a
               href="https://williamwolff.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/moulthrop-hypertext-1993.pdf">here</a>.</p>

     <h2>What is Hypertext?</h2>
     <p>The reading is about Hypertext, which is a kind of specially-formatted text that provides a link to other
          content. Unlike linear text (such as a book),
          hypertext allows you to immediately access text in various electronic sources by clicking on hyperlinks. You
          can learn more about hypertext <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/hypertext">here</a>.</p>

     <h2>Relevance to Today's Internet</h2>
     <p>The reading talks about how technology has changed our habits, particularly in how we interact with hyperlinks.
          Hypertext was once thought to replace books, providing a source of information where one can move to different
          sources of information. This ability to learn in a non-linear way is reflected in our modern use of
          technology.</p>
     <p>When we look at our interests, we can expand our knowledge based on patterns, such as hashtags or search engine
          results. These are prevalent on social media sites. However, while instant access to knowledge is convenient,
          it also contributes to a shorter attention span. The ability to consume multiple streams of information at
          once makes us less immersed in the technology we use. The nonlinear nature of hyperlinks can cause people to
          go down rabbit holes, sometimes to expand knowledge, but other times as a distraction.</p>
     <p>Additionally, apps that act as browsers, like Instagram, tend to centralize information around specific themes.
          For example, Instagram is often used for entertainment, so it may shadow ban certain agendas or concepts.</p>
