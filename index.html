        <p>Hi, I am Djibraeel Morojele. I am currently a student at Wits University.
          This website is part of an ongoing Interactive media assignment,  where I intend on
         making a full website depicting my portfolio as a student and as an artist. I will be
         posting blog posts based on the topics I am learning in web design. My portfolio will 
         depict my artworks across media, and I will also showcase my essays and assignments.
        I aim to make this a fully fledged artist website where I can communicate my artwork, provide contact for commissions and collaborations, and as a means to purchase art.
             I hope you enjoy this website and find it as clear and creative as I wish it to be.</p>
