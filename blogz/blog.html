    <h1>Blog 1: Tower of Bable</h1>

    </header>
    <article class="blog-content">
        <h2>Week 1</h2>

        <p>I have used GitHub before in 2nd year. It was intimidating then but now it is just foreboding.
            Maybe it is because I have not watched the video yet but there is a lot of new vocab for me,
            or rather instructions that sound like every 3rd word is made up.
            I suppose all words are made up. Hanli and Brendan made the experience followable so I am to the point where
            I
            need to deploy
            the website but my 15 minutes of concentration had finished so I here is where I lay. What do you mean
            deploy...
        </p>

        <p>A few days later... I asked a friend and they showed me how to deploy.</p>

        <p>Lets talk about the readings though.
            Most of them have a weird font so it pushed me to read the reading with the most reasonable readable
            writing.
            That happened to be the tower of babel. The tower of Babel is a bit slow and I was unsure what it had to do
            with
            anything until
            I remembered we are making websites.
        </p>

        <p>The tower of babel is a piece about this seemingly infinite library. A vessel for all knowledge.
            The walls of the library are mirrors, creating the perception of limitlessness. However, this library is
            finite, each book seems
            as though there are a random assortment of letters, however when you combine the words and books in certain
            combinations it
            actually provides an infinite source of knowledge. Just like the internet (to a degree). The random letters
            assorted correctly,
            give you info in the tower, but on the internet, it is links and code that do this. This assortment of
            random
            letters in a pattern
            send you to different websites with different information. The contemporary version of the tower of babel is
            the
            internet itself.
        </p>

        <h3>My goals for this course</h3>

        <p>I am an artist, and recently I have tried selling some of my work. I would like to have a website dedicated
            to my
            art.
            I want my website to be efficient and creative. I want my website to look almost sketch-like, the lines
            maybe
            not being as clean
            or organized but the aesthetics easily readable. I want to know what makes a good website and what makes a
            bad
            one.
            I am also looking for skills that cannot be replaced by AI.
        </p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p> This is my first time coding in html css and javascript. My course has yet to teach me how to code, they
            just
            gave us some unnecessarily long videos from covid. I tried to watch the videos but this dude was yapping
            about
            the world wide web and the internet, and its not that i dont care about that stuff... actually I dont. I
            would
            be
            more willing to watch the videos if this was my only course.</p>
        <p> Html is very boring to code, its just text and stuff, the only coding language that I kind of know is C#,
            and it
            was for game design.</p>
