       <h1>Blog 1: Tower of Bable</h1>

    </header>

    <h2>Week 1</h2>

    <p>I have used GitHub before in 2nd year. It was intimidating then but now it is just foreboding now.
        Maybe it is because I have not watched the video yet but there is a lot of new vocab for me,
        or rather instructions that sound like every 3rd word is made up.
        I suppose all words are made up. Hanli and Brendan made the experience followable so I am to the point where I
        need to deploy
        the website but my 15 minutes of concentration had finished so I here is where I lay. What do you mean deploy...
    </p>

    <p>A few days later... I asked a friend and they showed me how to deploy.</p>

    <p>Lets talk about the readings though.
        Most of them have a weird font so it pushed me to read the reading with the most reasonable readable writing.
        That happened to be the tower of babel. The tower of Babel is a bit slow and I was unsure what it had to do with
        anything until
        I remembered we are making websites.
    </p>

    <p>The tower of babel is a piece about this seemingly infinite library. A vessel for all knowledge.
        The walls of the library are mirrors, creating the perception of limitlessness. However, this library is
        infinite, each book seems
        as though there are a random assortment of letters, however when you combine the words and books in certain
        combinations it
        actually provides an infinite source of knowledge. Just like the internet (to a degree). The random letters
        assorted correctly,
        give you info in the tower, but on the internet, it is links and code that do this. This assortment of random
        letters in a pattern
        send you to different websites with different information. The contemporary version of the tower of babel is the
        internet itself.
    </p>

    <h3>My goals for this course</h3>

    <p>I am an artist, and recently I have tried selling some of my work. I would like to have a website dedicated to my
        art.
        I want my website to be efficient and creative. I want my website to look almost sketch-like, the lines maybe
        not being as clean
        or organized but the aesthetics easily readable. I want to know what makes a good website and what makes a bad
        one.
        I am also looking for skills that cannot be replaced by AI.
