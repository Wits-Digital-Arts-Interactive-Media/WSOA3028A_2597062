        <p> <a href="https://ortambo-airport.com/index.html" class="link">Visit OR Tambo International Airport
                Website</a>

        </p>
        <h3>Pros:</h3>
        <ul class="pros-cons">
            <li class="pros">The website offers a comprehensive range of services, including flight information,
                parking,
                hotel and car rental bookings, and airport transfers, which are easily accessible from a single
                platform.
            </li>
            <li class="pros">The inclusion of airport maps, flight route maps, and weather forecasts provides valuable
                visual information that can aid users in planning their travels.</li>
            <li class="pros">Detailed directories for shops, services, and dining options offer users a wealth of
                information to prepare for their airport visit.</li>
            <li class="pros">Live flight updates, advanced booking options, and a vast search engine for hotels and car
                rentals make the website highly functional.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cons:</h3>
        <ul class="pros-cons">
            <li class="cons">The abundance of options might overwhelm users, and the site could benefit from a more
                intuitive layout to enhance the user experience.</li>
            <li class="cons">There is no back to top option, so users have to scroll a lot.</li>
            <li class="cons">All the elements are a bit cluttered, so it may be confusing to distinguish things.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2> PicknPay</h2>
            <p> <a href="https://www.pnp.co.za/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw57exBhAsEiwAaIxaZim7NvCuqzjTL4GQEIeptsgZdWW-nC0_rW_HYdCkU9d-waMCNiLvHxoCLVkQAvD_BwE"
                    class="link"> Visit PicknPay website</a></p>
            <h3>Pros:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fast and Responsive: Pick n Pay's website is quick to load and responds promptly to user
                    interactions,
                    providing a seamless browsing experience.</li>
                <li>Conventional Shopping Experience: The website follows standard shopping website conventions, making
                    it
                    easy for users to navigate and find what they're looking for.</li>
                <li>Clear Pricing: Products are displayed with clear prices, and items are neatly separated, making it
                    easy
                    for users to understand the cost of each item.</li>
                <li>Expansive Product Information: Pick n Pay provides comprehensive information about its products,
                    helping
                    users make informed decisions about their purchases.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Cons:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Cluttered UI Design: The website's user interface design is cluttered, with an abundance of
                    different
                    colors and elements, making it visually overwhelming and not easy on the eyes.</li>
                <li>Lack of Product Descriptions: The absence of short descriptions for products means that users have
                    to
                    click on each item to get more information, which can be inconvenient and time-consuming. Adding
                    brief
                    descriptions would enhance the user experience by providing essential details at a glance, without
                    the
                    need for additional clicks.</li>
                <li>Inconsistent Font Usage: The website's use of fonts is inconsistent, leading to a lack of visual
                    harmony
                    and potentially confusing the user. Consistency in font choice and styling would improve readability
                    and
                    overall aesthetics.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>This week has been particularly challenging and demoralizing. I received a bad mark for my HTML assignment,
            which was a significant blow to my confidence. Despite the effort I put into understanding and applying the
            principles we learned, my work fell short of the expectations. This setback has made me question my
            abilities and my progress in this course.</p>
        <p>Adding to my frustration, several classes have been canceled recently. The lack of consistent instruction and
            feedback has made it difficult to stay motivated and keep up with the course material. I feel like I'm
            missing out on crucial learning opportunities, and the uncertainty around when the next class will be held
            only adds to my stress.</p>
