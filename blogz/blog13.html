                <h2>Shani Orgad's Reflection on Roger Silverstone's Views on the Internet as a Moral Space</h2>
                <p>Shani Orgad's reading sheds light on Roger Silverstone's views about the internet as a moral space.
                    Orgad brings out key points from Silverstone's work that challenge the usual ideas about online
                    communication and interactions.</p>

                <h3>Interconnected Media Environment</h3>
                <p>Firstly, Silverstone's view is that the internet isn't separate from other media; it's a part of the
                    broader media environment. He argued that the media environment is interconnected and deeply woven
                    into our daily lives. This means we need to study online activities alongside offline ones since the
                    two are intertwined.</p>

                <h3>Proper Distance in Communication</h3>
                <p>Secondly, Orgad delves into Silverstone's concept of "proper distance" in communication. Silverstone
                    believed in a media ethics that recognizes the "other" in communication, stressing "unconditional
                    responsibility" over mere reciprocity. This idea challenges much of the existing discussion about
                    the internet, which often focuses on reciprocity, connections, exchange, and interactivity without
                    considering the moral implications of online communications.</p>

                <h3>Critique of Connectivity and Sociability</h3>
                <p>Orgad also highlights Silverstone's critique of connectivity, sociability, networking, and
                    interactivity. He argued that these concepts often overlook the moral aspects of online
                    communication. Silverstone pointed out that closeness and even intimacy online don't necessarily
                    lead to recognition or responsibility, and a focus on reciprocity might exclude those who can't
                    engage in such exchanges.</p>

                <h3>Anonymity, Disembodiment, and Online Intimacy</h3>
                <p>Additionally, Orgad touches on Silverstone's concerns about anonymity, disembodiment, and online
                    intimacy in computer-mediated communication (CMC). Silverstone warned that the ability to "switch
                    off" in online interactions threatens our sense of responsibility and weakens the moral duty of
                    listeners to provide unconditional care.</p>

                <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
                <p>The way I worked like I was in a sweatshop to make this website felt very immoral. I am currently
                    finishing up my website, it looks like I am going to fail. Let's Hope Allah has my back. I am
                    waiting for my essay mark to come back so I know if I qualify to even submit this exam, but I have
                    not yet received them. I did not learn how to code from this course, it did however give me a
                    project where I could apply code that I learned. I mostly learned to code from Youtube. Css was the
                    most fun to learn, I felt like we should have learned it before java, but others probably think
                    differently seeing that their java nav bars work. I really tried my best. In any case, I hope you
                    enjoyed my website and check out my social media in my footer. Much loveâ€¦ actually much resentment.
