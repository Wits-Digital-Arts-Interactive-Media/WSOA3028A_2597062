          <h2>Week 2 Reading</h2>
          <p>For week 2, I did a reading called <em>‘You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media
                    (1991)’</em> by Moulthrop, S (2003). You can find the reading <a
                    href="https://williamwolff.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/moulthrop-hypertext-1993.pdf">here</a>.
          </p>
          <h2>What is Hypertext?</h2>
          <p>The reading is about Hypertext, which is a kind of specially-formatted text that provides a link to other
               content. Unlike linear text (such as a book), hypertext allows you to immediately access text in various
               electronic sources by clicking on hyperlinks. You can learn more about hypertext <a
                    href="https://techterms.com/definition/hypertext">here</a>.</p>
          <h2>Relevance to Today's Internet</h2>
          <p>The reading talks about how technology has changed our habits, particularly in how we interact with
               hyperlinks. Hypertext was once thought to replace books, providing a source of information where one can
               move to different sources of information. This ability to learn in a non-linear way is reflected in our
               modern use of technology.</p>
          <p>When we look at our interests, we can expand our knowledge based on patterns, such as hashtags or search
               engine results. These are prevalent on social media sites. However, while instant access to knowledge is
               convenient, it also contributes to a shorter attention span. The ability to consume multiple streams of
               information at once makes us less immersed in the technology we use. The nonlinear nature of hyperlinks
               can cause people to go down rabbit holes, sometimes to expand knowledge, but other times as a
               distraction.</p>
          <p>Additionally, apps that act as browsers, like Instagram, tend to centralize information around specific
               themes. For example, Instagram is often used for entertainment, so it may shadow ban certain agendas or
               concepts.</p>
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>Reflecting on this week's content, I must admit that I found the focus on the World Wide Web (WWW) and
               hypertext to be somewhat unnecessary for my personal learning journey. While I understand the historical
               significance and the theoretical underpinnings of hypertext, I couldn't help but feel detached from the
               material. My primary interest lies in creating and showcasing my art, and the technical details of the
               WWW seemed irrelevant to my goals. I believe my time could have been better spent on more practical
               aspects of web design and multimedia production that directly impact my work.</p>
          <p>Nonetheless, I recognize the importance of understanding the broader context in which digital art and
               interactive media exist. It's just that, for me, the intricate workings of the WWW do not resonate as
               strongly as the creative processes involved in bringing my visions to life. Moving forward, I hope to
               focus more on the artistic and design elements of my projects, which I find far more engaging and
               pertinent to my career aspirations.</p>
          <h2>URL Setup and Folder Structure</h2>
          <p>For my folder setup, I will have a folder for each of these things: Blog folder, Design folder, Portfolio
               folder, About folder, Essay folder, Image folder, and Scripts folder. In my blog folder, I will have a
               page for every blog. The home page will chill without a folder because it was the first index, and in my
               mind, it makes sense.</p>
