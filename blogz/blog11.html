            <h2>The JavaScript I added to my website</h2>
            <p>The JavaScript I added to my website includes a scroll-to-top button and the navigation bar. I still plan
                to add hover highlights for my buttons, which I also need to create. However, I'm experiencing problems
                with my JavaScript. I recently learned that only my PC has access to the live server, and my deployed
                page doesn’t recognize my JavaScript for some reason.</p>

            <h2>Reading Reflection</h2>
            <p>I chose the reading "Algorithmic Colonization of Africa" by Abeba Birhane. In this article, Birhane
                compares traditional colonization to digital colonization. He explains that both forms share a common
                goal: “Common to both traditional and algorithmic colonialism is the desire to dominate, monitor, and
                influence social, political, and cultural discourse through the control of core communication and
                infrastructure mediums.” He further discusses how both forms of colonization invent justifications for
                their actions. For example, a Facebook project justified capturing census data to create a population
                density map. Facebook essentially assumed the authority to map, control, and create population
                knowledge, thereby controlling perceived knowledge.</p>
            <p>This form of colonialism is subtle yet pervasive, often masquerading as technological innovation and
                solutions to social problems. Understanding how digital colonialism operates is crucial, though I joked
                about applying it to my website—unless, of course, I'm serious.</p>
            <p>Birhane emphasizes the importance of context-aware solutions and warns against the one-size-fits-all
                approach that ignores the unique challenges and values of African societies. This is particularly
                important because Africa is in a completely different context from the Western world. As a developing
                continent, we face different problems compared to developed countries. We need valid solutions to our
                problems, not digital colonialism with ulterior motives.</p>
            <p>Birhane also discusses ethical considerations that can help decolonize digital practices, primarily the
                involvement of local communities in the development process. The web and browsers have been inherently
                Western constructs. However, like music or art, Africa has innovations that haven't been considered
                yet—a completely new way of doing things and different intentions in our work. For instance, art
                collected from Africa during colonization was not seen as art by Africans but as tools for rituals.
                Similarly, what we create might be entirely different from what is currently assumed.</p>

            <h>Application to Work</h3>
                <p>If I were to apply these insights to my website, I wouldn’t consider my work colonialist because I am
                    African—lmao. However, I could research what African websites do differently. I don’t think I need
                    to worry about this issue unless I am making an innovation. Currently, I don’t have the coding
                    skills or knowledge to innovate, so don't hold your breath for any groundbreaking changes.</p>
