            <h2>Alignment</h2>
            <p>User Alignment - designing and structuring my website to meet the needs, expectations, and behaviors of
                the target users.</p>
            <p>My current main goal is to create a website as a new platform for my art as a portfolio and product.
                Additionally, I aim to achieve a good mark for my interactive media class, planning to have a
                responsive, accessible, and concise artistic website.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, I want my users to see my art and convey it in a creative way that highlights the art of web
                design.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>This week, I found myself grappling with a significant challenge: the lack of visual elements in the
                material we were studying. As someone who thrives on visual creativity and design, I struggled to find
                enjoyment in the process of building this part of my website. The theoretical and textual focus of the
                readings didn't provide the inspiration I needed to visualize my end goal. It felt as though I was
                trying to build something without a clear picture of what it should look like, making the task feel
                daunting and unfulfilling.</p>
            <p>My primary passion lies in creating visually engaging content that speaks to my artistic vision. Without
                any visual references or elements to guide my design process, I found it difficult to stay motivated and
                see the project through to completion. This experience has taught me that while understanding the
                underlying concepts and structures of web design is important, I need to find ways to incorporate visual
                creativity into every step of my work. Itâ€™s the visual aspects that truly ignite my passion and drive me
                to create compelling and interactive media.</p>
            <p>In the future, I hope to strike a better balance between the technical and the visual components of web
                design. I plan to integrate more visual elements and inspiration into my workflow, even when the primary
                focus of the task is more technical or textual. This will help me maintain my enthusiasm and ensure that
                my projects reflect both my artistic talents and my understanding of web design principles.</p>
